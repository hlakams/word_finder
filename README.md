# word_finder

This is a proof-of-concept substring finder which, by default, finds occurrences of the words 'mouse' and 'mice' within a user-defined input string. Aside from this input, the user can also specify the usage of custom strings and find conditions (as a substring or singular word) within the console interface.

Default ('mouse' is singular and 'mice' is a substring):
